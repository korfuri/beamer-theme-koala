# beamer-theme-koala
Beamer theme for the Koala team

I created these templates in 2010 for the Koala T.A. team at
Epitech. They've been left mostly untouched ever since, so I guess
they work well enough.

## How to use

Install LaTeX, pdflatex and Beamer. You will need various LaTeX
packages, like listings.

Create your beamer presentation. Copy `Makefile.template` and adapt it
to your needs. Run `make`.
